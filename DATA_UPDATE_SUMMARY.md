## Next Steps for UI Development

### Phase 1: Card Details Modal ✨
**Implement tooltip/modal next to card name showing:**
- Card image
- One-sentence card description  
- List of all non-trackable benefits (26 per card)
- Each benefit clickable to show additional details popup

### Phase 2: Enhanced Perk Details ✨
**Extend existing perk detail dialog to show:**
- Benefit type badge (credit/subscription/reimbursement/one-time)
- Recurring amount breakdown (e.g., "$25/month" for monthly benefits)
- Expiry date warning if applicable
- Full terms in expandable section

### Phase 3: Smart Filtering & Sorting ✨
**Enhanced dashboard features:**
- Filter by benefit type
- Show expiring benefits first
- Highlight one-time benefits not yet claimed
- Track spending-threshold benefits ($75K for CSR)

### Phase 4: Value Visualization ✨
**Better ROI tracking:**
- Separate one-time vs recurring value
- Show "lifetime value claimed" including one-time bonuses
- Calculate effective annual value (e.g., TSA PreCheck $120/4 years = $30/year)
- Track time-limited benefits separately (with expiry countdown)
